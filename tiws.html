			<p>"Tropical Medicine" refers to the practice of medicine in the tropics. But does it refer to all medical practice that takes place within the Tropics, does it refer to the practice of medicine within resource poor settings or does it refer to the diagnosis and treatment of infectious and parasitic diseases found in a tropical environment? There is no standard definition of Tropical Medicine. These days, Tropical Medicine is often referred to as global/geographical health or international health and it encompasses a number of sub specialties such as refugee healthcare, travel medicine and expedition or remote/wilderness medicine.three major infections of concern in the tropics and often specifically targeted together by funding agencies are malaria, HIV and tuberculosis.</p>
